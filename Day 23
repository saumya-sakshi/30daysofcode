Lucyâ€™s Neighbours (Level-Medium)
Lucy lives in house number X. She has a list of N house numbers in the society. Distance between houses can be determined by studying the difference between house numbers. Help her find out K's closest neighbors.
Note: If two houses are equidistant and Lucy has to pick only one, the house with the smaller house number is given preference.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5, X = 0, K = 4
a[] = {-21, 21, 4, -12, 20}, 
Output:
-21 -12 4 20
Explanation:
The closest neighbour is house
number 4. Followed by -12 and 20. -21 and 21 
are both equal distance from X=0. Therefore, 
Lucy can only pick 1. Based on the given 
condition she picks -21 as it is the smaller 
of the two.
Expected Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N)
Solution Code:
class Solution{
public:
vector<int> Kclosest(vector<int>arr, int n, int x, int k)
{
// Your code goes here
sort(arr.begin(),arr.end());
vector<pair<int,int> > ans;
for(int i =0;i<n;i++){
ans.push_back(make_pair(abs(arr[i]-x),i));
}
sort(ans.begin(),ans.end());
vector<int> result;
for(int j =0;j<k;j++)
{
result.push_back(arr[ans[j].second]);
}
sort(result.begin(),result.end());
return result;
}
};
