DAY2
Given a positive integer N. You have to find Nth natural number after removing all the numbers containing digit 9.

Example 1:
Input:
N = 8
Output:
8
Explanation:
After removing natural numbers which contains
digit 9, first 8 numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
and 8th number is 8.

Expected Time Complexity: O(logN)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10¹²

Solution Code:

class Solution {
  long findNth(long n)
  {
  //code here
    long result=0;
    long p=1;

    while(n>0){
      result+=(p*(n%9));
      n=n/9;
      p=p*10;

     }
    return result;
  }
}
