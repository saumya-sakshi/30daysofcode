Smallest Positive Integer that can not be represented as Sum

Given an array of size N, find the smallest positive integer value that cannot be represented as sum of some elements from the array.

EXAMPLE 1:
Input: 
N = 6
array[] = {1, 10, 3, 11, 6, 15}
Output: 
2
Explanation:
2 is the smallest integer value that cannot 
be represented as sum of elements from the array.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N * Log(N))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 106
1 â‰¤ array[i] â‰¤ 109
The array may contain duplicates.

SOLUTION CODE:-
class Solution {
  long smallestpositive(long[] arr, int n){
  // Your code goes here
    Arrays.sort(arr);
    long ans=1;
    for(long x :arr){
      if(x>ans)
      {
        return ans;
      }
      ans+=x;
    }
    return ans;

  }
}
